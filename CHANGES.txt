0.1.0 rc 1
------------------
* THIS TOTALLY AND ENTIRELY BREAKS PRIOR INTEGRATIONS
* simplifying interface
* splitting code into multiple files with better organization
* supporting Pillow , as PIL isn't really used by many people
* cleaning up S3 interface
* this entirely breaks older versions
* the older schema definitions ( dicts ) remain unchanged. the python
  integration has completely changed

notable changes :

* classes have been logically separated into different namespaces
* resizing does not automatically upload to s3 anymore. you must chain this
  in your own code
* s3logger objects
** kwarg `bucket` is now `bucket_name`
** kwarg `filesize` is now sent on upload



0.0.4 (2012-06-07)
------------------
- fixed setup script


0.0.3 (2012-03-25)
------------------
- not backwards compatible. sorry.

# Tracking the "archive" image was changed.

1. photo_sizes now reserve an initial @ character for internal usage
2. archived fullsize images are now tracked as:

	dict[bucket_name]['@archive'][filename]

before there was a dual-use dict, that was just hard to manage

	dict[public_bucket_name][size][filename]
	dict[archive_bucket_name][filename]

this created issues where you couldn't save the archived image to the same s3 bucket.  now you can.

# added s3_generate_filenames

this call just generates the filenames that would be saved to s3.
this is necessary for deletion or external auditing of your uploads

# added s3_delete

you can now delete s3 files

# this still doesn't have proper tests

check the demo.py
